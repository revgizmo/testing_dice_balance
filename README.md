# [testing_dice_balance](https://revgizmo.github.io/testing_dice_balance/)

This is a project to test dice for balance based on rolls and expected values.  The initial analysis is based on someone else's dice rolls, and I'll be adding proper references, etc. as I build the presentation around the analysis.

For the most part, there's nothing to see here.
