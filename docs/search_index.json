(Test roll results inside), since removed due to the dice pic) got me thinking about ways to capture fairness of dice rolls in R. u/VaraNiN kindly provided a simple analysis of test roll results with the associated detailed die rolls in his post, so here’s a quick summary. 1.1.0.1 Tl;dr: The dice look balanced. I would want to look at the 1s and 20s a little more if I were going to do more analysis. 1.2 Importing the data The data was posted in an Excel file on google drive (test roll results). A quick test with the googlesheets package convinced me that I was better off just downloading the excel file. I saved it in a ./data/raw/ folder. 1.2.1 File Format The Excel file consisted of 6 tabs, one for each die being tested. Data was organized in a very excel fashion, with data and calculations included on the same tabs, and the data listed in cells A5:… It took a little creativity to get the right cells, and there were just enough tabs to copy/paste rather than building a formula to do it this time. 1.2.2 Import I imported each sheet separately and saved just the data into 6 separate .csv files. I like to do this so that tidying begins on a standard and fixed set of data. d4: 80 rolls recorded d6: 120 rolls recorded d8: 160 rolls recorded d10: 200 rolls recorded d12: 240 rolls recorded d20: 600 rolls recorded That’s a total of 1400 rolls recorded. Warnings: There were 0 warnings during the import. They were: 1.3 Tidying the data 1.3.1 DataWrangle Data tidying was handled during Import (dice roll detail values were selected from within a more comprehensive spreadsheet that included summaries and analysis). Traditional datawrangling was not necessary. Responses were saved as .rds files. There were 0 warnings during the data tidying. They were: 1.4 Transforming the files for analysis To streamline the analysis, I consolidated the 6 groups of die rolls together into 1 tibble. die n D4 80 D6 120 D8 160 D10 200 D12 240 D20 600 1400 die rolls were prepared for analysis. There were 0 warnings during the transforms. They were: 1.5 Analyze the results of u/VaraNiN’s dice rolls 1.5.1 Testing the dice for balance based on rolls and expected values 1400 responses were loaded for analysis. 1.5.2 Chi-Square analysis based on rolls and expected values die sides roll_num expected_rolls_per_side roll_mean expected_mean chisq_p.value chisq_result_0.05 D4 4 80 20 2.5 2.5 0.96 Ok D6 6 120 20 3.5 3.5 0.35 Ok D8 8 160 20 4.7 4.5 0.41 Ok D10 10 200 20 5.2 5.5 0.21 Ok D12 12 240 20 6.6 6.5 0.23 Ok D20 20 600 30 10.5 10.5 0.98 Ok 1.6 Conclusions: The dice look balanced With all p-values &gt; 0.05, the first pass analysis results in a colloquial conclusion* that the dice are balanced. * lots of exceptions, details, and better explanations. 1.7 Future thoughts: I’m less concerned with misunderstanding of the implications of the p-values in this analysis, than I am with the conservative nature of the Chi-Square test for this kind of analysis. The variable representing the dice sides can move along the variable continuum from Nominal to Ratio based on use in various games. In the case of Dungeons and Dragons, the scale on the D20 is typically ordinal or interval from 2-19, with special exceptions for 1 and 20. A dice that is imbalanced with respect to 1 or 20 in Dungeons and Dragons would be of particular concern. The D12 graph above shows a potential example, with quite a few more 20s rolled than 1s. But that’s a conversation and analysis for another time. 1.8 Continuing exercise: Trying to model the power of the test. 1.9 Another reddit exercise: link Please help me to create a function of 8 sided bias die ( the question is in below) Here is the question: Roll a 8-sided biased die repeatedly. Define the ‘bias’ by yourself. Starting with roll k =1, let Nk denote the result of roll k. If Nk &gt; k, then you will roll again; otherwise you stop. Let R denote the number of rolls. Write a function: roll8( ) input: n (trials) output: n outcomes and R value ## [1] &quot;Rolls: 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;Results: &quot; ## [1] 1 ## [1] &quot;trial 1 rolls 32&quot; ## [1] &quot;trial 2 rolls 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;trial 3 rolls 6&quot; ## [1] &quot;Results: &quot; ## [1] 32 1 6 "]
