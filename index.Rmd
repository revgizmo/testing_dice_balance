#Thoughts on u/VaraNiN’s dice
##A small project to test dice for balance based on rolls and expected values

[u/VaraNiN](https://www.reddit.com/user/VaraNiN)'s recent post on Reddit about receiving some new dice ([[OC] After 9 weeks of waiting my steel dice are finally here! (Test roll results inside)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9g5gge/oc_after_9_weeks_of_waiting_my_steel_dice_are/?st=JM450M1H&sh=090282a1)) got me thinking about ways to capture fairness of dice rolls in R.  [u/VaraNiN](https://www.reddit.com/user/VaraNiN) kindly provided a simple analysis of [test roll results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oFhszSd7A210-YbTaEfz89A1eM7QgK5U/view?usp=sharing) with the associated detailed die rolls in his post, so here's a quick summary.
